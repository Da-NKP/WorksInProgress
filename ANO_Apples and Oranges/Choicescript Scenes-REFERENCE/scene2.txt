$charName was ready for today. She had Home-ec, which was easy and - alarmingly - interesting; History, which wasn't; Biology, which is the only class she was retaking; and English, which she equated to a mental Death March. However, what she was really looking forward was continuing her personal investigation. Now that she squeezed all of the information about John that she could from her classmates - albeit not much in retrospect - $charName was ready to question the Freshmen, optimistic that they would be more helpful, since the student body had nearly double the Freshmen than it did Sophomores. She did see some problems to that plan. First, they were Freshmen, and while they may be willing to gossip with an upperclassman, they may not be willing to share any actually useful information. This would require her to choose her words carefully when talking - interrogating - them.
