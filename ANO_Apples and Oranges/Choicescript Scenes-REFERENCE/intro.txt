"Hey, John! Wait up!" 

School was finally over. John was looking forward to a quick start of his weekend - that is, until that.

"Oh, hi." John replied, wondering how to make this as short as possible. Mara, his classmate and fellow senior, was not going to make it easy, though.

"Do you want to go to the party with me?" Mara stepped closer to John as she asked, causing John to fall back into his locker. 

She did not seem to notice, but moved a little closer, to make up for the distance John fell back, and continued. "Our entire class is going and there will be food and games and music and even a movie! It's going to be so much fun!"

John feared that this would happen. 

[i]I really want to go, especially with Mara. Spending time with classmates would be great! But going with her? I would love to, but what would my classmates think? What would she think if I responded too quickly? Worse still, what would the whole school think?[/i]

[i]What would I say? How would I say it? And why me - why did Mara ask me? "Not sure if romantic or just friendly."[/i]
John laughed a little before continuing his thought. 

[i]But really, I do not know her that well, and I know she could not possibly know me that well. But what if she thought she knew me? Or am I just over-thinking this?[/i]

"Well, John? Are you coming or not?"

His thoughts ran again. 

[i]Oh no! It has been nearly three minutes! Or was it five? Hmm... I am impressed that Mara waited that long for an answer, though. Forget that! I have to give her an answer. She cannot notice this, not now. I can feel my pulse, which means that she can probably tell that something is wrong. She was standing far too close to me; she had to have noticed! I have to answer! NOW![/i]

Mara started to ask John again, "Hey, is everything alri-"

"I can't go with you!" John half shouted, half cried.

He was frozen for a moment; Mara was stunned.
*page_break
[i]Ahh!!! That could have not been a worse response! How is Mara going to take that? What if she takes it personally? I cannot possibly go now. If I did, and I ran into her at the party, what would I say? Would she even ask?[/i]
*page_break
"I'm sorry," John stuttered, "but I just can't do this!"

He ran off, leaving a very confused Mara behind, not to mention several other slightly-less confused students who were in ear-shot of his cry.

Well, do you think this party is really "all that", or just some major case of hype?

Mara did not understand any of what happened. She soon left for the party, however, and quickly lost her confusion in, what she decided was, the most amazing party ever!

[i] I knew that this party was going to be awesome, [/i] she thought.

Mara did not understand any of what happened. She soon left for the party, however, and quickly lost her confusion in, what she decided was, the most lame party ever.

[i] I was really hoping this party would be different, [/i] she thought.
